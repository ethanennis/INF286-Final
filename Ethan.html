	Above is me, Ethan Ennis, I created this basketball website, based on my love of the NBA and basketball in general. </p>
	<p>I am a cross country and track runner at Northern Kentucky University, however my sport of choice, when it comes to watching, has always been basketball. </p>
	<p>With this passion, I elected to make a website about who I thought were the greatest players to play the game, and break them down by position.
